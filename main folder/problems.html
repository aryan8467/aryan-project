    <h2>Major Issues Affecting Farmers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpredictable Weather Patterns:</strong> Climate change has caused irregular monsoons and droughts, making farming less predictable.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> Inadequate irrigation and reliance on rainfall can make farming difficult, especially in arid regions.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lack of Access to Modern Technology:</strong> Many farmers still rely on outdated farming methods and lack access to advanced tools and technology.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Poor Market Access:</strong> Farmers often struggle to sell their crops at fair prices due to poor transportation and infrastructure.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Debt Trap:</strong> High-interest loans from informal lenders often push farmers into debt, leading to a vicious cycle.</li><br><br>

        </ul><br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Land Fragmentation:</strong> Due to inheritance laws, farm holdings become smaller over generations, making it less economically viable to farm efficiently.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Price Fluctuations:</strong> The lack of stable pricing for agricultural produce leads to inconsistent income for farmers.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Pest Infestation and Crop Diseases:</strong> Many farmers lack the resources to protect their crops from pests and diseases, leading to heavy losses.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Government Support Issues:</strong> Inconsistent implementation of government schemes and lack of awareness prevent farmers from benefitting fully.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Middlemen Exploitation:</strong> Farmers often receive lower prices for their produce due to exploitation by middlemen in the supply chain.</li><br>
