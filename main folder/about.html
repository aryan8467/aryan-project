        <h2>Overview of Indian Agriculture</h2>
        <p>Agriculture is the backbone of India's economy, contributing around 15-18% to its GDP and employing over 50% of the population. The agricultural sector in India encompasses various activities, including the cultivation of crops, livestock farming, aquaculture, and forestry.</p>
        <p>India is one of the world's largest producers of a range of agricultural products, including rice, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, and various fruits and vegetables. Despite its importance, Indian agriculture faces many challenges, such as outdated farming practices, lack of infrastructure, and changing climatic conditions.</p>

            <li><strong>Lack of Modern Technology:</strong> Many farmers still use outdated tools and techniques, which reduces efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Access Issues:</strong> Poor infrastructure limits farmers' ability to get fair prices for their produce.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Unpredictable weather patterns have had a significant impact on crop yields and food security.</li>
